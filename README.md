This is my official submission for  Fetch Rewards Android Internship Take Home Assessment.

NOTE: for Grouping and sorting based on the "Name" after we are done with the "listID", I was unsure whether we had to sort it based on lower to higher in in terms of item number or by string comparison on "Name" based on the instructions. As such, currently I have used a simple string comparison on the "Name". In case I had to sort it either lower to higher, or higher to lower, it could have also been done 
by sorting it based on the ID (using a conversion and int comparison) after the "ListID" grouping. I just was unsure what form of sorting/grouping the assessment was referring to.
